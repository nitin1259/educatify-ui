        <h2>Influence of Western Culture on Indian Society</h2>
        <p>
          India is a secular country where the people have the freedom to
          practice any religion and also to convert into another religion of
          their choice. So, all the cultures are freely accepted and respected
          by the Indians. Itâ€™s an environment to cultivate or build oneself
          ethically, socially and in all other aspects that lead an all over
          human development.
          <br />
          Every culture is a combination of some good and bad features. All in
          one, culture means â€˜a way of lifeâ€™. Every geographical body has
          its own custom viz. culture. People of different nations are
          recognized by their culture. One should be proud on its impressive
          traditions. It is the responsibility of all citizens to preserve their
          own ethnicity.
          <br />
          Indian culture is richly known in other parts of the world since the
          ancient age. Its multi-diverse flavour has been consistently unique in
          its very own way. Manners, traditions, living and trading patterns
          etc. are one of the graceful components of Indian culture. The most
          important feature of Indian culture is its values. These values are
          deeply rooted within the heart, mind, body and soul of its dwellers.
          <br />
          But, the influence of western culture started in India during the 19th
          century when the british established their colony in the country.
          Western culture, considered as the most advanced culture on globe, has
          started surmounting its flavour on Indian roots. Western culture has
          always shown its influence on Indian society. This could be for the
          multiple reasons like fascination, dreamy autonomy etc., which are
          somehow absent in Indian culture. Western culture conveys and promotes
          the ideas and values of advanced civilization across people of India.
          <br />
          There are ample of good things found in the western culture, which
          every Indian should proudly learn and adopt. But what about the
          negative influences of the western culture? Every package comes with
          pros and cons. Indians should definitely use the culture strain before
          getting diluted under the flow of any cultural influence. The leading
          reasons for such impact are pursuit of wealth and power of Western
          media.
          <br />
          The culture of India has been shaped not only by its long history,
          unique geography and diverse demography, but also by its ancient
          heritages. Regarded by some historians as the â€œoldest living
          civilization of Earthâ€, the Indian tradition dates back to 8,000 BC
          and has a continuous recorded history for over 2,500 years.
          <br />
          Westernization should not affect the core traditions of Indian society
          but may change the lifestyle and apparent characteristics of the
          society with the graceful add-ons like punctuality, trustworthiness,
          loyalty, professionalism should be welcomed and adored.
          <br />
          These changes are like the betraying our old way of life, which we
          obtained through our ancestors. Updating is necessary but getting
          washed-off in influence is wide of the mark. If this continues, days
          will not be far away when the famous Indian civilization would be
          buried not by others but by the Indian themselves.
          <br />
          Due to globalization the rich culture of India is disappearing. The
          most impact is of western culture on India culture. Western culture is
          based more on materialistic factors where as our culture has a
          spiritual base.
          <br />
          The culture of India is been disappearing by many ways the youths in
          India do not respect their elders, the families in India live
          separate. And thus have lost contacts with their other relatives the
          big point which is making the culture of India to disappear in
          bollywood the dressing style of the actresses, the slang word used in
          movies are been influenced the youth to bad step of life. The young
          ones try to act the same as these actors do which is very bad to the
          culture of India.
          <br />
          The lack of morals, the lacking faith in God, having late night
          parties, the influence of drugs and alcohols, least interest in Indian
          languages like Sanskrit, Hindi, Celebrating mothers day, fathers day,
          valentine day, fools day etc rather than celebrating our Indian
          festivals and thus wasting their precious time of life, Thinking to be
          independent at an early age
          <br />
          So, I strongly say that accept good from that and try to know our
          Indian culture more than u definitely change mind.
